# WeatherApp
In this project, we will build a PWA application to display the weather conditions of a city. Initially, we will learn how to configure the OpenWeather API, which we will use to get weather data. We will then learn how to use the API to display weather information in an Angular component. We will see how to convert our Angular application into PWA using a service worker. We will also implement a notification mechanism for our application updates. Finally, we will deploy our PWA application into the Firebase hosting provider.
